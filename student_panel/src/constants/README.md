# Constants

Here you can put any constant variables that are used throughout the application.
Itâ€™s a good practice to capitalise your constants to distinguish them from other
variables and localised constants in your app.
Below are some examples of defining and using constants.

1. [APP_NAME](#appname)
2. [APP_DESCRIPTION](#appdescription)

## APP_NAME


## APP_DESCRIPTION
